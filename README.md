# Basic Interface Gateway

This is used to connect to, and recieve messages from the SimSig interface gateway. This does nothing with the messages other than display them through standard output. It shows you how you can make a simple interface gateway, and allows you to see the types of messages that can be output.

In order to use this you will need the [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stomp.py](STOMP libary for Python)

This is the basis of the Interface Gateway that is used elsewhere in the project.
